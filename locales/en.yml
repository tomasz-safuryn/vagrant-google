    warn_networks: |-
      Warning! The Google provider doesn't support any of the Vagrant
      high-level network configurations (`config.vm.network`). They
      will be silently ignored.
    warn_ssh_vagrant_user: |-
      Warning! SSH credentials are not set (`ssh.username`, `ssh.private_key`).
      Unless Vagrant's default insecure private key is added to GCE metadata,
      "vagrant up" will timeout while trying to estabilish an ssh connection
      to the instance.
      NOTE! Adding Vagrant private key to GCE metadata is heavily discouraged,
      since it potentially allows anyone to connect to your instances,
      including those not managed by Vagrant.
    will_not_destroy: |-
      The instance '%{name}' will not be destroyed, since the confirmation
      was declined.
